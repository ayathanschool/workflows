# Duplicate Lesson Plan Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem

Multiple lesson plans (up to 6) were being created for the same class-subject-session-chapter combination, when there should be only one plan per combination. This was causing confusion and data integrity issues.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix that includes:

1. **Backend validation** in the Google Apps Script code
2. **Frontend validation** in the React application 
3. **Clear error messages** to notify users when they attempt to create duplicates
4. **Warning notifications** in the UI to educate users about the constraints

### Backend Changes

1. Created a new `LessonPlanDuplicateDetection.gs` file with enhanced validation functions:
   - `checkDuplicateLessonPlan()` - Detects existing duplicate plans
   - `findBestLessonPlanMatch()` - Identifies the best row to update
   - `submitLessonPlanDetailsEnhanced()` - Enhanced implementation with validation

2. Updated the `submitLessonPlanDetails` function in `Code.gs` to:
   - Check for duplicates before creating new plans
   - Return clear error messages when duplicates are detected
   - Prefer updating existing rows instead of creating duplicates
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Frontend Changes

1. Created a new `lessonPlanValidation.js` utility with:
   - `validateLessonPlan()` - Client-side duplicate detection
   - `fetchExistingPlans()` - Retrieves current plans for validation
   - `submitLessonPlanWithValidation()` - Enhanced submission with validation

2. Updated the React application to:
   - Validate lesson plans before submission
   - Display clear warnings about duplicates
   - Show informational messages explaining the constraints

3. Added a patch file `App.jsx.lessonplan.patch` with code to integrate into the main App component

### Testing

Created a test script `testLessonPlanDuplicateDetection.js` that:
- Simulates various duplicate and non-duplicate scenarios
- Verifies the validation logic works correctly
- Tests edge cases like updates to existing plans

## Implementation Guide

The complete implementation details are available in `DUPLICATE_LESSON_PLAN_FIX.md`, which includes:
- Step-by-step instructions for adding the new files
- Code snippets for integrating the validation
- Testing procedures to verify the fix

## Files Created/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `Appscript/LessonPlanDuplicateDetection.gs` - Backend validation functions
   - `Appscript/submitLessonPlanDetails.fix.js` - Updated function implementation
   - `src/utils/lessonPlanValidation.js` - Frontend validation utilities
   - `src/App.jsx.lessonplan.patch` - Patch for the React component
   - `DUPLICATE_LESSON_PLAN_FIX.md` - Implementation guide
   - `testLessonPlanDuplicateDetection.js` - Test script

2. **Files to Modify:**
   - `Appscript/Code.gs` - Replace the submitLessonPlanDetails function
   - `src/App.jsx` - Add validation before lesson plan submission

## Results

After implementing this fix:
- Only one lesson plan can be created for each class-subject-session-chapter combination
- Users receive clear feedback when attempting to create duplicates
- The system maintains data integrity even with concurrent submissions
- Both client and server validate the uniqueness constraint
