/**
 * SchoolFlow Authentication Fix
 * 
 * This script documents the fixes applied to resolve the Google OAuth authentication issues:
 * 
 * 1. Issue: "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call"
 *    Solution: Add popup configuration to useGoogleLogin hook
 * 
 * 2. Issue: Token handling issues (getting access_token but expecting id_token)
 *    Solution: Use access token to fetch user info from Google's userinfo endpoint
 * 
 * Changes applied:
 * 
 * 1. Modified GoogleAuthProvider.jsx:
 *    - Updated to handle access tokens returned by Google OAuth
 *    - Added code to fetch user info using Google's userinfo endpoint
 *    - Send user info to the backend instead of just the token
 *    - Added popup_url_options to fix Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy warnings
 * 
 * 2. Updated _handleGoogleLogin in Code.gs to handle the new flow:
 *    - Accept direct user info from frontend
 *    - Maintain legacy support for ID token validation
 *    - Added better error logging and response formatting
 * 
 * 3. Updated api.js:
 *    - Modified googleLogin function to handle user info object
 *    - Updated fallback GET method for legacy support
 * 
 * How this works:
 * 
 * With the new flow:
 * 1. User clicks login -> Google OAuth popup opens
 * 2. User authenticates with Google -> Google returns access token to frontend
 * 3. Frontend uses access token to fetch user info from Google's userinfo endpoint
 * 4. Frontend sends user info to backend in 'googleLogin' API call
 * 5. Backend verifies the user exists and returns user profile & roles
 * 
 * This approach avoids the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy warnings by setting proper popup options
 * and resolves token handling issues by using Google's userinfo endpoint.
