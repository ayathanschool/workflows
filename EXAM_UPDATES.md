# Exam Management System Update & Date Format Fix

## Changes Made:

### 1. Enhanced Role-Based Exam Management
- Created `ExamManagement.jsx` with proper role-based access:
  - **HM Role**: Can view all class exams, edit all marks, and create new exams
  - **Class Teacher Role**: Can edit marks for subjects in their assigned class, view all subject marks of their class
  - **Teacher Role**: Can view and edit marks only for their assigned subjects/classes

### 2. Date Format Improvements
- Added `formatShortDate()` function to `dateUtils.js` to display dates in a more compact format:
  ```javascript
  // Example: Wed Aug 20 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
  // Now displays as: Aug 20, 2025
  ```
- Using this function in exam management views to conserve space

### 3. Time Display for Teacher Timetable
- Added time period mapping to show actual times alongside period numbers:
  ```
  Period #1
  09:00 - 09:45
  ```

## How to Integrate:

1. For exam management, add this new component in your app's routing:
   ```jsx
   import ExamManagement from './components/ExamManagement';
   
   // In your route handler or component rendering logic:
   case 'exam-marks':
     return <ExamManagement user={user} />;
   ```

2. To use the new date formatting anywhere in the app:
   ```jsx
   import { formatShortDate } from './utils/dateUtils';
   
   // Usage
   <div>{formatShortDate(dateValue)}</div>
   ```

## Testing:
1. Login with different roles (HM, Class Teacher, Teacher)
2. Verify appropriate exam visibility and edit permissions
3. Confirm date displays are now compact and readable

All changes have been implemented and are ready for deployment.
