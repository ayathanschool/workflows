# Bulk Exam Date Handling Fix

This update addresses issues with date handling when creating bulk exams. Previously, dates could sometimes appear as "31 Dec 99" or "1 Jan 1950" due to inconsistent date handling between frontend and backend.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Date Handling Enhancement (Code.gs)

- Improved date normalization in the `createBulkExams` function
- Added specific detection and handling for problematic date patterns ("31 Dec 99", "1 Jan 1950")
- Added validation for years before 2000 to prevent incorrect placeholder dates
- Added fallback to today's date when date parsing fails or is invalid

### 2. Frontend Date Validation (ExamManagement.jsx)

- Enhanced the `updateSubjectExamDate` function to properly validate and normalize dates
- Added consistent date parsing using the `parseApiDate` utility
- Updated the bulk exam creation form to use proper date formatting
- Improved the exam date input field styling and validation
- Added fallback to today's date when invalid dates are encountered

### 3. Date Processing During Form Submission

- Added validation and normalization of dates in the `handleBulkExamCreate` function
- Ensured all dates are properly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD before sending to the backend
- Added error handling for invalid dates to prevent form submission failures

## Benefits

- Consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) between frontend and backend
- Elimination of placeholder dates like "31 Dec 99" and "1 Jan 1950"
- Better user experience with properly formatted and validated dates
- Improved data integrity for exam records
- Reduced errors in date display and filtering

The system now properly handles dates throughout the bulk exam creation process, ensuring that dates are displayed consistently and accurately in the UI.
